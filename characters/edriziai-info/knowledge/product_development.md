## Next Steps
1. Define core market
2. Build focused MVP
3. Establish feedback loops
4. Monitor key metrics
5. Prepare for pivots

Remember: Focus on one market first, build for that market's specific needs, and be ready to pivot when the data shows it's necessary. Don't try to build for multiple markets simultaneously - it rarely translates well from one to another.
