# HackDoc
**build ai hackathon 2025**

### overview
HackDoc is an **intelligent assistant** that helps users understand complex documents by **analyzing**, **summarizing**, and **extracting** key development-related insights. When a user uploads a product specification, planning document, or technical brief, the system leverages the **Upstage API** to parse its structure and extract important entities such as features, tech stacks, and deadlines. An AI Agent then reorganizes these insights into a developer-friendly format, enabling teams to save time, align quickly, and take meaningful action. 


### üîë Key Features
- 1Ô∏è‚É£ AI-Powered Document Understanding
Users can upload planning or technical documents,
 and the system uses the Upstage API to automatically analyze structure and extract key insights.
 ‚Üí An AI Agent then summarizes the content for quick understanding.

- 2Ô∏è‚É£ Developer-Friendly Output Format
The Agent delivers structured results focused on development:
 tech stacks, core features, API suggestions, and project milestones
 ‚Üí Saves time and improves communication across the team.

- 3Ô∏è‚É£ Web3 Integration for Monetization (Future-ready)
Agents can be registered on the NEAR blockchain,
 and their outputs can be turned into IP assets using Story Protocol
 ‚Üí Enabling ownership, usage tracking, and monetization of AI-generated knowledge.

- 4Ô∏è‚É£ Scalable Toward Code Generation & Execution (Vision)
By integrating with Cursor IDE and MCP Server,
 the system can evolve into a full development assistant
 ‚Üí From document ‚Üí to summary ‚Üí to real-time code creation.

- 5Ô∏è‚É£ Simple Web Interface for Non-Developers
No coding required‚Äîjust upload a document.
 The platform handles everything from parsing to generating developer-ready insights.
 ‚Üí Ideal for product managers, designers, and researchers.
