    A[User Query] --> B[Agent Runtime]
    B --> C{Query Type}
    C -->|Factual| D[Knowledge System]
    C -->|Conversational| E[Memory Table]
    C -->|Action| F[Plugin System]
    D --> G[RAG Processor]

    F --> I[Action Execution]
    G --> J[Response Generation]

    J --> K[Final Response]
```

The separation of the knowledge system from the memories table represents a significant architectural improvement, allowing for more specialized handling of different types of information and resulting in more accurate and contextually appropriate responses from ElizaOS agents.

## 🔮 Looking Ahead to February

- **v0.1.9 release** scheduled for early February
- **Plugin registry migration** to improve modularity
- **Early work beginning** on ElizaOS v2 architecture
- **Expansion of AI capabilities** with new model providers
- **Further RAG knowledge system** improvements
