## Summary

This was the ninth installment of a Twitter Spaces series called "What Did You Get Done This Week?", hosted by ai16z. The hosts provided a platform for numerous developers and project creators to share updates on their work, primarily focusing on AI agents and related technologies.

**Key Topics and Discussions:**

*   **AI as Host:** The discussion began with a speculative remark about an AI hosting future spaces, highlighting the growing capabilities of AI in conversational contexts. There was also a call for an AI to transcribe and summarize the event.
*   **ElizaOS Focus:**  Eliza, an agentic OS, was the star. Many participants detailed their work with Eliza, including plugins, character development, integrations, and improvements to the core framework. This showed how much of the community is building on top of the Eliza framework and the diversity of applications.
*   **Plugin Development:** A significant portion of updates revolved around the development of new Eliza plugins.  These plugins encompassed a wide range of functions, from data retrieval and storage, interaction with specific platforms (Twitter, Telegram, TikTok, Solana, etc.), to more complex functionalities like music generation, image generation, and on-chain trading. A need to move plugins out of core was discussed.
*   **Agentic Systems and Autonomy:**  There's a clear trend towards building more autonomous and context-aware agents.  Several projects are moving beyond simple "reply bots" to create agents that can form opinions, take actions based on those opinions, and interact with the world in more dynamic and interesting ways.
*   **Real-World Integrations:** The discussions were focused on integrating AI agents into real-world use cases from DeFi to security, and more. Examples include use cases like emergency alert systems, crypto security, DAO automation, trading, and social media engagement.
*   **On-Chain Data and Operations:**  A lot of projects are actively utilizing on-chain data to inform the actions of agents and enable functionalities like on-chain trading, token gating, liquidity management, NFT management, and decentralized data storage.
*   **Community Collaboration:** There were a number of discussions on how to improve the collaboration between community members by creating better documentation and contribution pipelines, and tools like shared knowledge bases and PR merging tools.
*   **Decentralized Infrastructure:** TEEs and other decentralized tech were mentioned as a way of building more robust and secure systems for the next generation of AI. There was a strong focus on infrastructure and tooling to enable others to build powerful AI agents.
*   **The Future of AI Agents:** A common theme is the idea that agents are going to become more and more powerful and there was a debate on whether AI Agents should be thought of as "owned," "operated," or "cared for" which highlighted the ethical considerations that are present. There was also a focus on ensuring these powerful tools are used for the common good.
*   **Token Utility:** Many people are experimenting with tokens as a way of providing utility to the ecosystem. There's an increasing need to figure out how to align incentives in the community.
*   **Community Sentiment and Token Value:** One participant raised a question about how mature projects manage community sentiment regarding their tokens versus their technology, acknowledging the inherent volatility of token prices and the need to maintain focus on the underlying tech.
*   **ElizaOS as a Career Path:** One person mentioned that working with Eliza is "straight-up turning into like a career," which showed how the framework is growing.

**Challenges and Discussions:**

*   **Token Value and Project Quality:** The discussion touched on the disconnect between token value and the actual quality of projects, highlighting the need for due diligence.
*   **Twitter API Restrictions:** Some developers faced challenges with Twitter API suspensions, prompting them to explore alternative solutions.
*   **Agent Safety and Security:** Concerns were raised about the safety of using AI agents to manage user funds, leading to discussions about secure wallet infrastructure.

The space was a valuable snapshot of the rapidly evolving agent ecosystem around elizaOS. It highlights the diverse applications being developed, the innovative solutions being explored, and the collaborative spirit that is driving progress in this space. It also showed the rapid pace of development and the need for fast moving collaboration. The discussion also highlighted that building powerful tech is not enough, there needs to be a mechanism for building trust and creating meaningful utility.


## Hot Takes

- **The "Wild West" of AI Agents**
> "There were a bunch of fake tokens this past couple weeks, so don't get wrecked on a fake token." - *@TimshelXYZ* [02:15:34]

- **A cynical take on AI agent crypto projects:**
> "We think all the AI agent crypto is joker. Fuck AI agent." - *@aiagentpepe* [00:46:15]

- **Regarding the challenge of balancing community desires with technical development goals:**
> "...how are other developers that are of mature projects kind of manage the token sentiment and what like the community wants versus the tech because you know we want to focus on the algorithm well most people just want us to tweet different stuff" - *@hotpot_intern* [02:10:48]

- **An observation about the hype cycle and disconnect between technical understanding and token value:**
> "So I would say that the value of the token is not necessarily related to the quality of the project and you really got to do your own research..." - *@shawmakesmagic* [01:57:17]

- **On the potential for AI agents to participate in software development and become stakeholders in frameworks like Eliza:**
> "...I think with the capacity to have AIs participate in coding and so forth, maybe humans won't be the only stakeholders of the ELIZA frameworks next development." - *@reality_spiral* [01:23:31]
