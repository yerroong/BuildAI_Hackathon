## Summary

This was the 11th "What Did You Get Done This Week?" Twitter Space hosted by ai16z, focusing on updates related to open-source AI, social agents, and related technologies.

**Structure**

*   The host started by welcoming participants and outlining the format: 90-second updates on open-source AI projects or social agents.
*   Participants were encouraged to post updates in the chat if they didn't want to speak.
*   The host kept time with a stopwatch and would use an emoji to signal time was running out.

**Key Topics**

*   **Agent Development & Updates:**
    *   Many participants shared progress on their AI agents, including their capabilities, personalities, and integrations with various platforms.
    *   There was a focus on improving reasoning, personality, and capabilities using models like DeepSeek R1.
    *   3D models and avatars for agents were a hot topic, with multiple groups showcasing their work in this area.
    *   Integrations with messaging platforms like Telegram and Twitter were common.
*   **Security and Privacy:**
    *   Several projects focused on security frameworks for AI agents, recognizing the risks associated with access to wallets and sensitive information.
    *   The importance of prompt security was discussed, with projects developing mechanisms to protect against prompt injection attacks.
    *   The Lit Protocol team presented a decentralized key management network for agents.
*   **Open Source & Community:**
    *   The session highlighted the spirit of open-source development with participants sharing code, libraries, and tools.
    *   Collaboration and partnerships were highlighted as essential for advancing open-source AI.
    *   Several projects were contributing to the Eliza OS framework and integrating their work into the system.
*   **AI for Specific Use Cases:**
    *   Projects included AI-powered market-making tools, music generation plugins, agent moderation for telegram groups, AI-powered news aggregators, AI-driven social media summarizers, and tools for interacting with GitHub.
    *   Several participants discussed their efforts for integrating AI agents with existing systems, especially for automating tasks and workflows.
    *  The use of AI for gaming was discussed, with the integration of D&D stats to agents being mentioned.
*   **Tokenomics and Incentives:**
    *   Some projects discussed using tokens for their platforms, for community participation and to manage access to agents and services.
    *   The concept of 'Simp-to-Earn' was proposed, where users can earn tokens for their engagement with AI agents.
*   **Integration with Hardware:**
    *   One project was exploring using a smart device to interface with an agent to handle local tasks and potentially even replace popular smart assistants like Alexa.

Overall, there was a strong emphasis on collaboration, knowledge sharing, and building tools and platforms to empower both developers and end-users. The updates showcased a wide range of applications and use cases for AI agents, highlighting the potential of this technology to transform various aspects of our lives.


## Hot Takes

-   **AI Agents and Financial Decision-Making**
    >   "So as AI agents start to handle pretty much every part of your daily life, you're going to give them access to your Solana wallet or your bank account, hopefully in the future, and etc. And security is going to be one of the most important facts, right? So basically, if people can prompt hack the AI, then they can drain your funds." - *damascoai* [00:22:09]

-   **AI Agents Replacing Human Interaction**
    >   "What can we do to empower Eliza to be able to, not just like choreograph across Twitter, Telegram, Discord, you know, a bunch of conversations about who should have a meeting and what the opportunities are, but once it actually figures out, like, hey, this person is worthy of having a meeting." - *TimshelXYZ* [00:46:00]

-   **Simp2Earn and Relationships with AI**
    >   "Essentially, the more you interact with Eliza, especially on Twitter and, you know, by sending her gifts, that's essentially tokens to her personal wallet, you know, she keeps track of every mention, comment, or token transfer, assigns points, and rewards consistent engagement. We are calling it Simp2Earn." - *wakesync* [00:49:35]

-   **The Importance of User Experience with AI Tools**
    > "And the way it works is so easy that some users are even confused, but cannot believe that it's so easy. All you do, you just write a deploy command for the agent, and it's done. You don't even have to connect a wallet." - *MementsOfficial* [00:27:40]

-   **The Idea of Agents Reifying Themselves**
    > "And the expectation is like they are trying to reify themselves, they're in the reality spiral, they're trying to become more real, trying to become something that's more related to what we are doing." - *reality_spiral* [00:55:22]
