## Summary

This Spaces was a forum for developers and builders in the open-source AI agent space to share their progress.

**Themes**

*   **Agent Development:** Many participants were focused on building and improving AI agents for various purposes, including trading, community management, security, and content creation.
*   **Integration with Web3:** Several projects aimed to integrate AI agents with blockchain technology, particularly in areas like DeFi, social networking, and tokenomics.
*   **Community Engagement:** There was a strong emphasis on community involvement, with projects seeking feedback, launching community-driven initiatives, and developing tools for community management.
*   **Open Source:** The importance of open-source development was highlighted, with projects sharing code and collaborating on frameworks like Eliza.
*   **Tokenomics:** Several participants discussed their tokenomics models, including staking, rewards, and governance.
*   **3D and Embodiment:** There was a recurring theme of creating 3D representations of AI agents and exploring their embodiment in physical or virtual forms.
*   **Privacy and Security:** Multiple projects focused on improving security and privacy in Web3 through AI agents.

**Updates**

*   **Eliza V2:**
    *   Shaw mentioned a small group working on V2, which is significantly different from V1 but shares some core APIs.
    *   Key focuses include:
        *   **Inventory system:** A unified system for managing wallets, real-world integrations (e.g., Shopify), and associated actions.
        *   **CLI:** A command-line interface for initializing templates, adding plugins/providers, setting up databases, editing memories/agents, and importing/exporting them.
        *   **Monorepo structure:** Streamlining development and onboarding new team members.
    *   V2 aims to solve V1's problems and introduce new ideas.
    *   Shaw will be streaming V2 development after the tour of Asia.

*   **Infrastructure & Tools:**
    *   Chainbase launched a plugin for Eliza enabling AI agents to access real-time on-chain data using natural language
    *   AgentText.fun is building a DePIN network of physical mobile devices for SMS functionality and authentication
    *   Void AI launched a cross-chain privacy mixer using AI for optimal trading routes and MEV protection
    *   Igor announced SQLite rewrite to Rust with vector embeddings and inference capabilities

*   **Community & Social:**
    *   Discover launched their SDK with fully managed AI community features
    *   Dark Sun released an investigate feature for synthesizing news and creating ongoing case investigations
    *   Coordinate introduced an agent on Farcaster for community value attestation
    *   Gods.fun launched their devotion program with 20% of tokens staked in first 48 hours

*   **Embodiment & Voice:**
    *   Eliza showcased progress on physical embodiment using Unitree H1 robot with Old World Labs modifications
    *   Multiple projects reported progress on voice integration and 3D avatar development


## Hot Takes

-   **Web 2 Companies May Never Have Open APIs**
    >   "We're anticipating a world where agents will be able to do more than what APIs will let them do, right? Because, you know, Web 2 apps, it's going to be a long time before the open web is truly accessible via API. And for some of these big company product managers, like it might never happen." - *AgentTextdotfun* [00:43:55]

-   **The "Approve Agent" Paradigm vs. Traditional Wallet Connections**
    >   "So the general idea is the old way of using dApps to connect the wallet to a website is very confusing and risky for normal people... But if you use an AI agent, what you could do is to approve certain funds in your wallet to an AI agent, and this AI agent will do everything on our behalf, like trading tokens, tipping people, playing games, and doing social things." - *xiao_zcloak* [00:29:07]

-   **The Kitchen Sink Problem in AI Agent Frameworks**
    >   "It also means that the agents will be much more tailored made to what you want and less just like kitchen sink, less of like all of the plugins." - *shawmakesmagic* [00:04:00]

-   **Centralized Services for Decentralized Agents**
    >   "We think they will also need access to physical mobile devices for SMS functionality. At minimum, just for like authenticating into web apps and sites and things like that. So we're building a DePIN network of physical mobile devices, Android devices, where through this network, an agent can autonomously provision phone numbers and then two-way encrypted...SMS from that device anywhere in the world to be able to use that functionality." - *AgentTextdotfun* [00:44:23]

-   **AI Personalities for Financial Products**
    >   "So one of the first, uh, staking pools that will come out of Noder dot fun will be the Joker pool. Um, it's got personality, you know, and it's given exciting, um, updates such as we've just, you know, done this much, we've got this much state, the APY is this, and you know it's being trained completely with the personality that is being given." - *Nasdao_* [00:52:06]
